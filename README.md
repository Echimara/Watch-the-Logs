# Watch-the-Logs

* This bash script monitors and reports who logs in to and out of whichever Linux machine the script is run on. <br>
* Reports are printed every 10 seconds (if any) along with the date and number of logged-in users.  <br> 
* A custom handler is present to trap the SIGINT or ctrl+C shortcut once before terminating the script. <br>

## HOW TO RUN: In a terminal (e.g powershell, git, putty e.t.c)
1) ```chmod +x minor2.sh```     --> to make sure the file is executable 
2) ```./minor2.sh```          --> to compile
3) ```ctrl + C twice```       --> to terminate
